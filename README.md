## Project Overview

This project presents a **comprehensive HR analytics dashboard** designed to analyze **employee attrition** and uncover the key factors influencing workforce turnover.

The objective is to transform raw HR data into **actionable insights** that support **data-driven decision-making** in employee retention strategies.

The analysis focuses on identifying patterns across:

- Job roles
- Age groups
- Satisfaction levels
- Training frequency
- Promotion history
- Demographic factors

to better understand **why employees leave** the organization.

## Business Problem

Employee attrition can significantly impact:

- Organizational performance
- Productivity
- Hiring & replacement costs

### Key Questions Answered

- What is the **overall attrition rate**?
- Which **job roles** experience the highest turnover?
- Are specific **age groups** or **demographics** more likely to leave?
- Does **job satisfaction** influence attrition?
- Do **promotions** and **training participation** affect retention?
- Is **workload** (e.g., overtime) linked to higher turnover?

## Methodology

The project follows this structured analytical approach:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**
   - Handling categorical variables
   - Grouping age categories
   - Ensuring consistent metrics

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Attrition rate calculation
   - Cross-analysis by department, job role, and demographics
   - Comparison between retained vs. exited employees

3. **Dashboard Development**
   - KPI indicators
   - Comparative bar charts
   - Satisfaction and demographic breakdown
   - Promotion and training analysis

## Key Findings

- Overall **attrition rate ≈ 16%** (moderate turnover)
- Employees aged **26–35** show the **highest attrition** levels
- **Operational** and **sales-related roles** exhibit significantly higher turnover
- **Lower job satisfaction** is strongly associated with increased attrition
- **Promotion** and **training frequency** show only minor differences between stayers and leavers
- **Overtime** workload appears to contribute to attrition — especially in specific job roles

## Dashboard Highlights

The final dashboard includes:

- **Attrition Rate** KPI
- Attrition by **Job Role** (bar chart)
- Attrition by **Age Group**
- Attrition by **Gender**
- **Job Satisfaction** Distribution
- **Promotion** & **Training** Comparison (stayers vs. leavers)
- Impact of **Marital Status**

The layout emphasizes **clarity**, **structured visual grouping**, and **business-oriented storytelling**.
