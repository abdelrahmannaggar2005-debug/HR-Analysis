# HR-Analysis
Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive HR analytics dashboard designed to analyze employee attrition and uncover the key factors influencing workforce turnover.

The objective is to transform raw HR data into actionable insights that support data-driven decision-making in employee retention strategies.

The analysis focuses on identifying patterns across job roles, age groups, satisfaction levels, training frequency, promotion history, and demographic factors to better understand why employees leave the organization.

Business Problem

Employee attrition can significantly impact organizational performance, productivity, and hiring costs.

This project aims to answer the following questions:

What is the overall attrition rate?

Which job roles experience the highest turnover?

Are specific age groups or demographics more likely to leave?

Does job satisfaction influence attrition?

Do promotions and training participation affect retention?

Is workload (e.g., overtime) linked to higher turnover?

Methodology

The project follows a structured analytical approach:

Data Cleaning and Preparation

Handling categorical variables

Grouping age categories

Ensuring consistent metrics

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Attrition rate calculation

Cross-analysis by department, job role, and demographics

Comparison between retained and exited employees

Dashboard Development

KPI indicators

Comparative bar charts

Satisfaction and demographic breakdown

Promotion and training analysis

Key Findings

The overall attrition rate is approximately 16 percent, indicating moderate turnover.

Employees aged 26–35 show the highest attrition levels.

Certain operational and sales-related roles exhibit significantly higher turnover.

Lower job satisfaction is strongly associated with increased attrition.

Promotion and training frequency show minor differences between employees who stayed and those who left.

Overtime workload appears to contribute to attrition in specific job roles.
